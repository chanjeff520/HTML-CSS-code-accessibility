# HTML-CSS-Code-Accessibility

## Discription

We were task to update an existing source code for HTML/CSS so that the code will be more accessible and more easily read for other programmers. I changed the all the div in the HTML code so the code would have semetics elements. I also added altributes to all imgs and move the img to the HTML code instead of being in the CSS. Lastly, I added a more meaningful title instead of being just "website".
