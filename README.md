# HTML-CSS-Code-Accessibility

## Technologies Used
 - HTML - ulitlized to create the structure for the page.
 - CSS - Style the HTML/page.
 - Git - version control that can track changes to source code.
 - Github - repository that has the source codes and has the GitHub Pages.

## Discription
We were task to update an existing source code for HTML/CSS so that the code will be more accessible and more easily read for other programmers. I changed the all the div in the HTML code so the code would have semetics elements. I also added altributes to all imgs and move the img to the HTML code instead of being in the CSS. Lastly, I added a more meaningful title instead of being just "website".

## Code Snippet

```html
        <header>
            <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>

```
Above is part of the html code as of now. Before, the code had no sementic elements and the spacing/indentation made the program harder to digest.
